# 2nd-Year-Academic-Projects
Coursework and individual projects from 2nd year courses at McMaster University

Notable assignments are an implementation of Conway's Game of Life in C++ in the 2AA4- Python and C++ folder 
as well as working with images and Genetic Algorithms in the C Programming folder.

Conwayâ€™s Game of Life: Implemented with C++, with formal design specification and terminal graphical interface. 
Able to take any kind of user input and correctly follows the intended behaviour of the game.

Genetic Algorithms: Worked with a partner to code a genetic algorithm to simulate the mutation and increasing fitness of a population of pixels in C code.
