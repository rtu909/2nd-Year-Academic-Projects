## @brief Allocates students to departments based on code defined allocation scheme.
#  @details
#       The code defined allocation scheme is as follows:
#           1. Free choice students are allocated before students without free choice.
#           2. Students with higher GPAs are allocated first.
#           3. Students with failing GPAs or GPAs above the maximum are not allocated.
#           4. Students who cannot fit into any of departments they chose are not allocated to any department.
#  @param S The list of students represented by dictionaries that map data categories to corresponding data.
#  @param F The list of mac ids of students who have free choice.
#  @param C A dictionary that maps department names to their capacity.
#  @return A dictionary mapping departments to a list of students allocated to that department.
